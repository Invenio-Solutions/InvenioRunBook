## Python Introduction 

- Python is an object-oriented language, and everything in Python is an object. This has the advantages of data hiding and modularity. It allows reusability, modularity, polymorphism, data encapsulation, and inheritance.

- For Python, PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. In this article, we are going to discuss some of the best practices that a programmer must follow while programming in python. Python as a language has evolved to a great extent over the last few decades and has gained popularity amongst a lot of software programmers, data enthusiasts, and system administrators. 

## Overview of PEP

- As per the official documentation – “PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. A PEP is a design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes or environment. The PEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.” You can read more about PEP here. Basically, PEP enables the developers to propose new features to the python community, raise and track issues with the community and also document the design decisions for implementing a particular feature within python.
