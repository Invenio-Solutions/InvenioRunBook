## Django Introduction

Django is a high-level Python framework. Django is a web application framework written in Python programming language. It is free and open-source, written in Python itself, and follows the model-view-template architectural pattern. We can use it to develop quality web applications faster and easier. Since developing for the web needs a set of similar components, we can use a framework. This way, we donâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel. These tasks include authentication, forms, uploading files, management panels, and so.
