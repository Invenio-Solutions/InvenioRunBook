# Python Deployment
Deployment involves packaging up your web application and putting it in a production environment that can run the app. Python web application deployments are comprised of many pieces that need to be individually configured.

## Deployment hosting options

- "Bare metal" servers
- Virtualized servers
- Infrastructure-as-a-service
- Platform-as-a-service

>The deployer needs to provision one or more servers with a Linux distribution. System packages, a web server, WSGI server, database and the Python environment are then installed. Finally the application can be pulled from source and installed in the environment.

## Deployment tools

- **teletraan** is the deploy system used by the development teams at Pinterest, a huge Python shop!

- **pants** is a build system originally created at Twitter and now split out as its own sustainable open source project.

- **Screwdriver** is an open source build system originally developed at Yahoo! that is now open source. Learn more about it in the introduction post that contains the rationale for its creation.
