This playbook is a series of strategies and approaches our organisation adopts in its digital delivery to help us and our clients succeed online.

# Why a Playbook?
 InvenioLSI has been blessed to be working with various Developers and clients over long periods such that there is a never-ending flow of ideas from the stakeholders. However, each idea comes with there own set of implementation procedures, which over time, can become difficult to manage. This playbook is an attempt to streamline those ideas, to get coherence between different working branches of InvenioLSI

# Who this Playbook is for?

- This playbook is designed to achieve greater synchronization between different verticals of InvenioLSI, such that any application created has a predefined set of rules and paradigms, and the management has a smooth time figuring out the technicals.
