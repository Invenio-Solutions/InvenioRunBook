# What is a Playbook?
This refers to a series of strategies and approaches our organisation adopts in its digital delivery to help us succeed online.

# Why a Playbook?
 InvenioLSI has been blessed to be working with various Developers and clients alike such that there is a never-ending flow of ideas from the stakeholders. However, each idea comes with there own set of implementation procedures, which over time, can become difficult to manage. This playbook is an attempt to streamline those ideas, to get coherence between different working branches of InvenioLSI

# Who this Playbook is for?

 This playbook is for any new developers, or new Organisations that we work with, to get a feel of how SDLC goes in InvenioLSI.
