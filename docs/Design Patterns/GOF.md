# GoF (Gang of Four) Pattern :

>Invenio advocates the use of GOF patterns wherever necessary for creational, behavioral and structural patterns while designing the classes agnostic to the language that supports OOP like Java, C++ etc.

The GoF Patterns can be broadly classified into three categories:

1. Creational Patterns

2. Behavioral Patterns

3. Structural Patterns


## Creational Patterns

The creational pattern gives insight on creation of single object or group of related objects. This patterns is useful with polymorphism.  There are five creational design pattern.

##  Structural Patterns

Structural Patterns reflects on how the objects and the classes are related. There are seven structural pattern in GoF. There are seven structural patterns.

## Behavioral Patterns

The behavioral pattern of GoF highlights on how the classes and object communicates among each other. There are eleven behavioral patterns.
