## Mule Flows:

- Mule flows must be simple and clear. 
- It is preffered that a Mule flow is kept short focussing on a single work. This appraoch can help in acheiving a great **test coverage**. Read more about testing in mule [here.](Testing.md)
- Only the variables required for the flow must be defined.
- External Component calls must be equipped with exception handling
- To advocate reusablity and individualizing of logics, flow references must be used.
