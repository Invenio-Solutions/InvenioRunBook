# Testing in Mule

Testng is an important part of software development as it is an innate requirement that the errors and vulnerablities of a code are being idetified and mitigated at an very early stage. This will ensure that the code design when integrated in the production environment works efficiently. To test an application in mule, MUnit can be used. MUnit is a testing framework provided by Mule. 

> An efficient Munit Testing module must keep the following into consideration

### Unit Test should cover a single flow at a time
- This will falicitate visibility and help in tracing the cause of the error.
- Testing of independent subflow is always recommended.
- However, if a subflow has certain dependency on the main flow, it must be test together to understand and test the working.

### A unit test must encompass a single aspect of a flow
- It is preffered that single conditions or parameters are covered in a unit test.
- The test classes can be segregated based on the funcionality and interface.

### Mocking
- Mocking of external data is important, as the test flow must not have dependency on external applications.
- The query parameters, uri parameters etc can be mocked using the set-message component.
- It is to be noted that MUnit does not have mocking for Connectors and Transports. Thereby it is important that we carefully carry out the test operations for WRITE, UPDATE and DELETE.

### Simple Tips:
- Maintaining of proper naming convention that aligns with the target flow is important.
- It is important that we cover maximum of the software testing with minimal coding.
- Incorporating multiple test ensures the robstness of the solution provided.
- Inclusion of MUnit test must be prior to bug fixing.
