## Mule Project:

- Use of Maven for creating Mule Projects is recommended. 
- Seperate XML file must be created for proper readalbility. The segregation can be based on:
     - Global Elements
     - Use case or resource implementation 
     - Common structures or logic 
- Seperate packages for resources such as DataWeave, WSDLs should be created.
- Formatting and Indentation of the XML files must be checked.
- The global elements must be included in a configuration file
- Also, seperate application.properties file must be created to efficiently manage different environment for the mule application.
