# API SECURITY

Invenio prioritizes on  the incorporation of the enterprise security standards at all possible level to provide integrity and confidentiality of the data of the client.  API security broadly encompasses the following three components based on which the security standards are being set:

1 **Identity and Access Management** : This principles ensures the users, applications and the servers are authenticated and authorized to consume the services provided by an API. Security Practices such as Multi-Factor Authentication, Token-Based access, Role Based Access are incorporated to ensure the same.

2 **Content Integrity and Confidentiality** : Integrity and Confidentiality of the data being transmitted is one of the important factor that needs to be considered. Disparity of data can cause adverse effect on an organization. Security Practices such as digital signature, digital certificates and public-key cryptography are some measures. 

3 **API Availability and Reliability** : In the present times, with microservices led architecture it is important that the services provided by an API are always available to respond without compromising on the integrity of the data. Horizantal Scaling can be done to acheive the same.


### How this can be acheived with Mulesoft?

Mulesoft addresses these security spectrums and provides solution that can be incorporated to acheive maximum API security.The provision for automated security and governance of API is innate in Mulesoft's Anypoint Platform. Mule has imbibed **HTTPS Connector**, **Mule Secure Token Service Oauth2.0 Provider**, **Mule HA Clusters** and many more measures are available to maintain the primary principles of security. Along with it, **AnyPoint Monitoring** , **Policies** are certain ways in which the performance can be monitored and security measures can be curated.

[API Security Best Practices](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/whitepaper/api/protect-apis) has provided a detailed documentation on the practices to be included to ensure maximum security of a Mule Process.

Also, the following video too summarizes the security standards provided by MuleSoft.
