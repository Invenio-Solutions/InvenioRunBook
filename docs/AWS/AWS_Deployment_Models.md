## Introduction

Amazon Web Services offers multiple options for provisioning your IT infrastructure and the deployment of your applications. Whether it is a simple three-tier application or a complex set of workloads, the deployment model varies from customer to customer.

For example, several sizing options are available to roll out an application on [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](aws.amazon.com/ec2) instance along with various scaling mechanics for adding compute and storage capacity. For persistent data storage needs, [Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)](aws.amazon.com/ebs) has tiered offerings such as general purpose (SSD), provisioned IOPS (SSD) and magnetic EBS volumes. For data that is static in nature, you can use [Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](aws.amazon.com/s3)and [Amazon Glacier](aws.amazon.com/glacier) for archival purposes. For data that is relational in nature, you can leverage [Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)](aws.amazon.com/rds), for data warehousing, you can use [Amazon Redshift](aws.amazon.com/redshift).If you need storage with pre-defined throughput,you can leverage [Amazon DynamoDB](aws.amazon.com/dynamodb) and for real-time processing, you can use [Amazon Kinesis](aws.amazon.com/kinesis).
