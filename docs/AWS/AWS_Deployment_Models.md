## Introduction

Amazon Web Services offers multiple options for provisioning your IT infrastructure and the deployment of your applications. Whether it is a simple three-tier application or a complex set of workloads, the deployment model varies from customer to customer.

For example, several sizing options are available to roll out an application on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance along with various scaling mechanics for adding compute and storage capacity. For persistent data storage needs, Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) has tiered offerings such as general purpose (SSD), provisioned IOPS (SSD) and magnetic EBS volumes. For data that is static in nature, you can use Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)and Amazon Glacier for archival purposes. For data that is relational in nature, you can leverage Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), for data warehousing, you can use Amazon Redshift. If you need storage with pre-defined throughput,you can leverage Amazon DynamoDB and for real-time processing, you can use Amazon Kinesis.
