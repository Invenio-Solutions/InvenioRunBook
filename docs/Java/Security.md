# Security
The core principles of security in Java are driven by **interoperable** and **extensible Provider implementations**. A particular implementation of Provider may implement some or all of the security services.

Some of the typical services implemented by a provider are:
- Cryptographic Algorithms (such as DSA, RSA, or SHA-256)
- Key generation, conversion, and management facilities (such as for algorithm-specific keys)
