# Security
>  Security is an inevitable part for creating an effective and reliable application. InvenioLsi ensures the incoporation of standard security practices into its applications.

[Java Features](JavaFeatures.md) elaborates on how the features of Java makes it a secure platform .Java has an ample of APIs, tools, implementations, security algorithms, protocols that facilitates the incoroporation of securtiy measures to an application.  These ranges from provision of security frameworks to tools for managing the applications. The core principles of security in Java are driven by **interoperable** and **extensible Provider implementations**. A particular implementation of Provider may implement some or all of the security services. Some of the typical services implemented by a provider are:
- Cryptographic Algorithms (such as DSA, RSA, or SHA-256)
- Key generation, conversion, and management facilities (such as for algorithm-specific keys)
