# Cryptography

Cryptography is the cornerstone of security features in Java. It refers to the tools and techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversaries.

## Cryptography in Java

The Java Cryptographic Architecture (JCA) provides a framework to access and implement cryptographic functionalities in Java, including:

- Digital signatures
- Message digests
- Symmetric and asymmetric ciphers
- Message authentication codes
- Key generators and key factories

Java makes the best use of **Provider-based implementations** for cryptographic functions and includes built-in providers for cryptographic algorithms like RSA, DSA, AND AES. Along with this, *SHA1 algorithm* is used to scramble and store the passwords. This process is reffered to as *cryptographic hash function*.
