# Testing Framework
Java unit testing frameworks provide programmers with a standardized, sophisticated, and extensible means to build a web application or other softwares. Java testing frameworks incorporate libraries, compilers, tools, and APIs. They have provision for built-in functions and modules to enable efficiency and speed for the developers and testers.

## Advantages Of Using Java Testing Frameworks

- Security: Frameworks offers security to the applications and also helps mitigate security problems at a speedy pace.
- Support: Community support for frameworks are available to address the issues in the code.
- Efficiency: Pre-written tasks makes it easier to write the test codes.
- Expense:  The cost of maintenance for Java frameworks is relatively low.

## Java Testing Frameworks
There ae different Java Testing Frameworks available for QA testers. Some of the best Java Testing Frameworks:
- ### **JUnit**

    JUnit is one of the popular Java unit testing frameworks. The unit test is used in a path function or for testing a small piece of code. It plays a vital role in test-driven development and is a part of the collective unit test frameworks called xUnit.
    JUnit boosts the initiative of *“to begin with testing than coding”*. This technique is based on “test a little, code a little” technique.  It enhances the programmer’s productivity and program code’s stability, which in turn reduces the pressure on the programmer and minimizes the time spent on debugging.
    #### Features of JUnit
    - JUnit offers test runners to execute tests.
    - Enables to write enhanced tests at an expedited pace.
    - Offers annotations to simplify writing and maintaining of tests.
    - Offers assertions to test anticipated outcomes.
    - Less complicated and takes minimum time to execute.
    - Test suites can contain test cases as well as other test suites.

- ### **Selenium**

     Selenium is an automated open-source testing framework, that is used for cross browser testing. It is to control and manage web browsers through the program. This reduces the effort involved in the maintenance of the code. Three kinds of framework by Selenium for the automation of manual test cases: Keyword Driven Tests, Data-Driven Tests, and Hybrid Tests.
     #### Features of Selenium
     - Selenium Integrated Development Environment gives a record and playback trait for authoring tests and for creating Selenium scripts for future reference.
    - Selenium supports several programming languages, OSs, and browsers:
    - Operating Systems: iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Solaris, Linux.
    - Browsers: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera, etc.
    - Programming Languages: Java, C#, PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.
    - Supports parallel test execution, which increases efficiency and reduces the test execution time.
    - It can be integrated with frameworks such as Ant, Maven, etc.

- ### **TestNG**

    TestNG is open-source testing framework that is more robust framework compared to other test automation frameworks. It is inspired by JUnit and NUnit. Its features like grouping tests, annotations, parameterization, etc., helps in creating tests at a faster pace.
   
    #### Features of TestNG
     - Provides myriad kinds of after/ before annotations for support of distinct setup and cleanup choices.
    - Allows users to perform data-driven testing
    - Test suites in this framework are configured mainly utilizing XML files (i.e., testng.xml)
    - Supports testing integrated classes.
    - Provides flexible plugin API and flexible runtime configuration.
    - Supports dependent test methods, load test, parallel tests, and partial failure.
    - Support for multiple threaded testing.

- ### **HTTPUnit**

    HTTPunit testing framework is based on JUnit. It imitates browser behavior like Page redirection, Form Submission, cookie management, and JS Validation etc. It mimics the web browser. The framework also supports automatic page redirection, HTTP basic access authentication, HTML form submission, JavaScript, and cookies. This permits Java test code to process restored pages like XML Document Object Model (DOM), text, or containers of tables, forms, links, etc.

    #### Features of HTTPUnit
    - Used to test websites without any web browser.
    - Support for cookies.
    - Support for the HTTPS as well as HTTP  protocols, along with support for HTML responses.
    - It enables the test of web applications, and due to this, it also assists in regression tests.
    - HTTPUnit is faster than other frameworks such as Selenium as you do not require a web browser for the tests.
    - Better JavaScript support enables imitating the actions of the configured browser (Internet Explorer or Firefox).
    - Proxy server support as well as great JavaScript support.
